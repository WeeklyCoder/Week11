# Week11
Dir Express | Directory Shortener to calm the folder navigation chaos and endless clicks

## 🥅 Goal:
- to simplify directory navigation. It is to allow users to create and use custom shortcuts for quick access to specific folders. Much like a URL shortener; but for folders.

## 🎁 Benefit:
- reduced the time spent on navigating lengthy directory paths.

## 💡 Question:
- Yes, you could make shortcuts of the folders but if you have more than a handful, you'll find them cluttering your desktop. 

## 🆚 Difference:
- Through this tool, however, the goal is to have an instantly accessible search bar on which shortcodes can be entered leading to opening of corresponding folders.

## 🧰 Usage:
- [1] A user enters a long directory path they want shortened.
- [2] A short random string of characters is generated (which can be customized for better memorability).
- [3] Searching by a shortcode opens the corresponding folder.

## 💡 Where to start? (Ideas)
- Provide a way to insert a full directory path
- Generate/Ask for a unique string as a short code
- Save them in a table as a CSV [long dir path | shortened path]
